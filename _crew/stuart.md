Hello, my name is Stuart Turner and I'm the founder of [Robots and Cake!][robots].

Back in 2004 I was a [Comp Sci (AI)][ai] undergraduate. I began losing function in my arms and legs, which later I learned was due to [cervical spina bifida][spina bifida] with [tethered spinal cord syndrome][tethered] and [chiari malformation][chiari].

I had to leave uni in my last year as I lost the ability to type and use a mouse and had no realistic alternatives in those days. I'm now [quadriplegic][quadriplegic], but over the intervening years I developed a pretty decent voice operated system, using [Dragon Dictate for Mac][dragon], [Keystrokes][keystrokes], [Tracker Pro][tracker], [Alfred][alfred] and a whole hotchpotch of things, and I'm  coding again, without my hands.

As a natural tinkerer, I've got myself involved in loads of beta testing over the years and now consult as an accessibility software tester, both in [OSPs][osp] and professionally. Some of my favourite projects I've beta tested on are: [Apple iOS7][ios7], [Apple iOS8][ios8], [Apple OS X 10.9 Mavericks][mavericks], [Apple OS X 10.10 Yosemite][yosemite] and [AO3][ao3], (there's a lot of As in this list!). I launched Robots and Cake in 2014 after testing on the EMPOWER interface. In 2014 I also completed and moved into an accessible smarthome, built by Brocklyn Designs and joint funded with the [NHS][nhs]. In 2015 I gave a talk on the design approach to and development of this house at [Wuthering Bytes Conference][wuthering] and in 2016 launched a new project and site called [Inventability][inventability], as a resource for others who want to apply similar approaches.

I am a strong advocate for thinking about how to re-purpose and hack mainstream products to be usable for people with profound disabilities. I collaborate with lots of different groups [MindRDR][mindrdr] app ake pictures using [Google Glass][glass], the [Neurosky MindWave Mobile Headset][neurosky] and the power of my brain. [Check it out over here.][google_glass_mind]

One of my favourite robot experiences so far has been helping [Professor Chad Jenkins][chad] at [Brown University][brown] test a [user interface][ui] for the [Robot Operating System][ros], a general-purpose [Operating System][os] for a whole variety of different robots.  This meant that I was able to fly a [Parrot AR Drone][parrot] using my head movements, right index finger, a web browser and all from over 3000 miles away. This all came about after making friends with [Henry Evans][henry] from the [Robots for Humanity][r4h] project.

I talk about all of these things regularly. You can find many of my talks on [Youtube][youtube]. I'd highlight [Wired 2014 London Conference][wired], where I remotely flew a drone live on stage, and [Google Firestarters 20][firestarters20] 2016 (will be online soon) as of particular interest.

If I can help you with anything, feel free to [email me][email].
