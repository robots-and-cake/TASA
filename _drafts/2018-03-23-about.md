The Todmorden Aeronautical Space Agency (TASA) are a Robots and Cake project to capture high-resolution pictures of Todmorden and see the curvature of the Earth, whilst also ensuring the payload come safely back to Earth.

If Elon Musk can do it, so can we!

To make this a fair fight with Mr Musk we are going to set some limits on project costs, scope and manpower.  As it stands he has billions of dollars, the best rocket scientists in the world and, you know, rockets and stuff.  Whereas TASA has one quadriplegic (me), the former mayor of Todmorden and my 10-year-old niece (who has a labcoat.  Obviously, because Space).

## The Rules ##

1. The whole mission has to be accomplished in 50 days from the date of the launch of this website.
2. You have to use as little to no money as is possible, raiding your own and others' peoples spare Electronics drawers is permitted under rule 14b
3. The payload must return back to where it was launched from with high resolution image/images of the Todmorden Valley, including non-fisheye lens video of the curvature of the Earth.
4. Finally, unless you have a quadriplegic on staff at SpaceX I'm afraid you're going to need to draw straws to see who gets pushed in front of the bus to make the team is more even.  Harsh but fair I think.
